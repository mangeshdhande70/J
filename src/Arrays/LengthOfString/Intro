  Array - an array is a collection of similar type of elements which has contiguous memory location.

  Advantages
    1) Code Optimization: It makes the code optimized, we can retrieve or sort the data efficiently.
    2) Random access: We can get any data located at an index position.


  Disadvantages
    1) Size Limit: We can store only the fixed size of elements in the array. It doesn't grow its size at runtime.
                   To solve this problem, collection framework is used in Java which grows automatically.


               How to create a Array:


               int []a = new int[size_of_array];

               or

               int []a = { elements in arrays };


     ##  Time Complexity: O(n)
     ##  Auxiliary Space : O(1)
