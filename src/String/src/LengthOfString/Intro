String --
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  Generally, String is a sequence of characters. But in Java, string is an object that represents a sequence of
  characters. The java.lang.String class is used to create a string object.

How to create a string object?
There are two ways to create String object:
   - By string literal
   - By new keyword


   ***** The Java String is immutable which means it cannot be changed. Whenever we change any string,
        a new instance is created. For mutable strings, you can use StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes. ****

## we cannot change the existing value of object that's why String called Immutable.
