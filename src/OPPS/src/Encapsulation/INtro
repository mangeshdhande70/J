What is Encapsulation in Java and How to Implement It?

Encapsulation in Java is a powerful mechanism for storing the data members and data methods of a class together.
It is done in the form of a secure field accessible by only the members of the same class.

Encapsulation in Java is the process by which data (variables) and the code that acts upon them (methods)
are integrated as a single unit. By encapsulating a class's variables, other classes cannot access them,
and only the methods of the class can access them.


why we need encapsulation?


Better Control -
       Encapsulation provides ultimate control over the data members and data methods inside the class.

Getter and Setter -
      The standard IDEs provide in-built support for ‘Getter and Setter’ methods,
      which increases the programming pace.

Security -
      Encapsulation prevents access to data members and data methods by any external classes.
       The encapsulation process improves the security of the encapsulated data.

Flexibility -
      Changes made to one part of the code can be successfully implemented without affecting any
      other part of the code.
