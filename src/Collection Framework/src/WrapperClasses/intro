The wrapper class in Java provides the mechanism to convert primitive into object and object into primitive.






Autoboxing

The automatic conversion of primitive data type into its corresponding wrapper class is known as autoboxing,
for example, byte to Byte, char to Character, int to Integer, long to Long, float to Float, boolean to Boolean,
double to Double, and short to Short.




Unboxing

The automatic conversion of wrapper type into its corresponding primitive type is known as unboxing.
It is the reverse process of autoboxing.
