Class  -  A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of
          properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.

          •	class is a group of properties and functions.

          Class class_name{            // every class in java extends Object class
                  //data member
                 //member functions
          }




Objects -  An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object.

           •	Object is an instance of a class.
           •	Object occupies space in memory.
           •	It is physical stuff.
           •	Object store in heap memory.
           •	every Object created their own memory.





           How to create objects:

                       Student stud1 = new Student();

           •	Student – it is a user_defined class.
           •	stud1  -  Reference var.
           •	new – we use the new keyword in java to instantiate the class via allocating the memory
                      for a new object, after which we return a reference to that memory.

-                 **   new is use to getting new memory in the heap memory
