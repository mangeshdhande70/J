Time Complexity:
                  The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm
                  to run as a function of the length of the input.
                  Note that the time to run is a function
                  of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the
                  algorithm is running on.


        ##    In simple word , it gives the relationship between how time will grow as size will increase.
