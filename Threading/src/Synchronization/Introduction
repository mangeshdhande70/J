      Synchronization is a modifier that is used for the method and blocks only.With the help of a
      synchronized modifier, we can restrict a shared resource to be accessed only by one thread.
      When two or more threads need access to shared resources, there is some loss of data i.e. data
      inconsistency.The process by which we can achieve data consistency between multiple threads
      is called Synchronization.

There are two types of locking in java.

        1. Object level locking
        2. Class level locking




Object level locking:

        Object level locking means you want to synchronize non static method or block so that it can be
        accessed by only one thread at a time for that instance. It is used if you want to protect non
        static data.



Class level locking:

    Class level locking means you want to synchronize static method or block so that it can be accessed
    by only one thread for whole class. If you have 10 instances of class, only one thread will be able
    to access only one method or block of any one instance at a time. It is used if you want to protect
    static data.
