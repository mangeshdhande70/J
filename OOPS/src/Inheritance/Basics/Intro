 Inheritance - It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allowed to inherit the
               features(fields and methods) of another class.

  Types of Inheritance in Java

    Below are the different types of inheritance which are supported by Java.

    1. Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, subclasses inherit the features of one superclass.
       In the image below, class A serves as a base class for the derived class B.

                       Class A
                          |
                          |
                       Class B


    2. Multilevel Inheritance: In Multilevel Inheritance, a derived class will be inheriting a base class and
       as well as the derived class also act as the base class to other class. In the below image, class A serves
       as a base class for the derived class B, which in turn serves as a base class for the derived class C.

                         Class A
                            |
                            |
                         Class B
                            |
                            |
                         Class C


    3. Hierarchical Inheritance: In Hierarchical Inheritance, one class serves as a superclass (base class) for more
       than one subclass. In the below image, class A serves as a base class for the derived class B, C and D.


                               Class A


                   Class B     Class C    Class D


    4. Multiple Inheritance (Through Interfaces): In Multiple inheritances, one class can have more than one
       superclass and inherit features from all parent classes. Please note that Java does not support multiple
       inheritances with classes. In java, we can achieve multiple inheritances only through Interfaces.
       In the image below, Class C is derived from interface A and B.


       #####   Java not support Multiple Inheritance but we can accomplished that using Interface

       why java not supported Multiple Inheritance?

             ex.

             public class Multiple_Not_supported {

                 public static void main(String[] args) {

                 C obj = new C();
                 obj.fun3();
                 obj.fun();  // here we get a problem bcz then fun() function are in class B as well in Class A ,
                               so which function will called and there create ambiguity issue, therefore java not
                               supported Multiple Inheritance

                 }

             }

             class A{

                 public void fun(){
                     System.out.println("Inside class A");
                 }

             }

             class B {

                 public void fun2()
                 {
                     System.out.println("Inside class B");
                 }
                 public void fun(){
                   System.out.println("Inside class B");

                   }

             }

             class C extends B,A{

                 public void fun3(){
                   System.out.println("Inside class c");
                 }
             }
