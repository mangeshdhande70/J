Constructor –
 Constructor is a special function that designed for initialization of an object

•	A constructor in java is a special method function that is uses to initialize object.
•	The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.
•	It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.
•	At the time of calling constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.
•	Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.
•	A constructor in Java can not be abstract, final, static, or Synchronized.
•	Access modifiers can be used in constructor declaration to control its access i.e which other class can call the constructor.


Note: it is not necessary to write a constructor for a class. It is because java compiler creates a default constructor if your class doesn’t have any.


How Constructors are Different From Methods in Java?

•	Constructors must have the same name as the class within which it is defined while it is not necessary for the method in Java.
•	Constructors do not return any type while method(s) have the return type or void if does not return any value.
•	Constructors are called only once at the time of Object creation while method(s) can be called any number of times.
