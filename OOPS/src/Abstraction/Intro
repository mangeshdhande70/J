An abstract class in Java is one that is declared with the abstract keyword.
It may have both abstract and non-abstract methods(methods with bodies).
An abstract is a java modifier applicable for classes and methods in java but not for Variables.


  - An instance of an abstract class can not be created.
  - Constructors are allowed.
  - We can have an abstract class without any abstract method.

  - abstract Class -- not able to create Object hence, abstract class cannot be final
  - abstract Method ---- without a body or Implementation and abstract method can't be final
  - abstract variable -- Not Possible
